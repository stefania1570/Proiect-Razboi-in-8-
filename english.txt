"War in 8" is a rational game for all ages. Two people take part 
in the game, each of whom is looking to get out from the 
opposing armed struggle. The game can end with victory to 
one of the players, or undecided, draw. During the game, 
by alternatingmoves the black and white soldiers seek to 
circle the enemy soldiers. Moving a part is done only in
 a neighboring square on the diagonal and free. Rule basic
 in the course of the fight says that the piece that after
 a blocked move will be removed from the game board without
 receiving the right to re-enter the fight.
